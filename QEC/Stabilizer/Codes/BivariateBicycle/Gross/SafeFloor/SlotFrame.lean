# Phase 6: the slot frame (A4 §10) — analytic infrastructure for the safe-sector floor

This module replaces the native-decidable confined-floor engine (`MImFloor`,
`floorOK`, the `~2³⁰` per-orbit enumeration) with the **analytic slot-frame
argument** of the self-contained proof (`qec-lab:docs/gross-distance-proof.md` §10).

The endpoint each orbit rep must reach is the closed coset-weight obligation
exposed by `MImClassify.chainWeight_coset_eq`:
```
∀ f, 12 ≤ costFromComps (shifted (seamOffL/R ζ psiⱼ) multⱼ (compF f psiⱼ))
```
This file builds the §10 substrate that the per-orbit walks (`WtFloor24`,
`WtFloor1618`, `RhoKills`) use to discharge that obligation structurally:

* **`floor_of_data_analytic`** — the integration bridge: a per-rep analytic
  `costFromComps ≥ 12` becomes the real `chainWeight ≥ 12` via
  `chainWeight_coset_eq`.  Its signature mirrors `MImMembership.floor_of_data`,
  so the consuming `MImFloorY*` / `MImAssembly` chain needs no edits.
* **Slots, kill vector, labelings** (§10.1): `kappa`, the labeling vectors
  `ellL = ℓ = κ(B̂)`, `ellR = ℓ' = κ(Â₃)`, the parity vectors `theta`, `thetaT`.
* **Lemma 19** (labeling facts): `ellL`/`ellR` are bijective slot maps, the
  Frobenius identities, and `κ(Â₄) = ω²ℓ` — all finite `decide` facts over F₄.
* **The per-slot cost lower bound** (§10.2, Lemma 20): `slotLB`, a lower bound
  on `wt5OfComps` keyed on the alive pattern, with soundness `slotLB_le` by a
  finite check over the 512 component tuples.

## Convention bridge (lab notes → repo) — inherited from `MImClassify`

Repo `∂₂ f = (A⋆f | B⋆f)`: A-block at `j = 0`, B-block at `j = 1`.
**Repo-left = lab-right**.  Slots are `Z₂² = {(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)}` in the
order `(e, x, y, xy)`; F₄ is `Fin 4` with `(0,1,ω,ω²) = (0,1,2,3)`.

/-! ## §0 The integration bridge

`floor_of_data_analytic` is the analytic analogue of `MImMembership.floor_of_data`:
given the per-rep analytic floor on `costFromComps`, it produces the real
`chainWeight ≥ 12` by rewriting through `chainWeight_coset_eq`.  Its hypothesis
`h` is *exactly* the RHS of `chainWeight_coset_eq`, so a downstream `Yr.floor`
built from it has the identical signature `(f) → 12 ≤ chainWeight (seamC zrep + ∂₂ f)`
that `MImAssembly` consumes — the engine swap is invisible above this line. -/

/-- **The analytic floor bridge.**  A per-rep analytic lower bound on the closed
coset-weight form `costFromComps` lifts to the real chain-weight floor.  Reuses
`chainWeight_coset_eq` (MImClassify §7) verbatim; the proof is one rewrite. -/

/-! ## §1 Slots, the kill vector, and the labeling vectors (A4 §10.1)

`Ring = Z₂² → F₄` is the slot-value representation.  The group-algebra element
`XY = ∑_g g` is the all-ones `uv = (1,1,1,1)`; its slot value at the slot
`xy = (1,1)` is the free constant `δ`.  The **kill vector** records the slot
function modulo that free `δ`-shift: `κ(v)(s) = v(s) + v(xy)` (so `κ(v)(xy) = 0`). -/

/-- The kill vector `κ(v)(s) = v(s) + v(xy)`: the slot function modulo the free
constant `XY`-shift.  `κ(v)` always vanishes at the slot `xy = (1,1)`. -/

/-- The labeling vector `ℓ' := κ(Â₃) = (ω², 1, ω, 0)`.  (`Â₃ = Â₁ = Ahat1` has

/-! ## §2 The per-slot cost lower bounds (A4 §10.2, Lemma 20 — the M-tables)

The closed coset weight `costFromComps` is a sum over the four `Z₂²` slots of
`wt5OfComps` of the ten CRT components.  Per the slot-cost rules, the cheapest
realization of a slot datum minimizes over the block's *free unit-side* component
(the `unitHat`-multiplied one: component `2` on the A/left block, component `1` on
the B/right block — recall repo-left = lab-right).  The min-over-free-component
lower bound `mFree2`/`mFree1` therefore lower-bounds the exact per-slot weight.

These are proved by `omega` over the four opaque `wt5OfComps` values — **no
`decide`/`native_decide`**, so they are axiom-clean (standard three only).  They
are the load-bearing per-slot bound that the orbit walks sum over the slots. -/

/-- Min over component 1 of the per-slot weight (the B/right-block free component). -/
def mFree1 (v0 v2 v3 v4 : Fin 4) : Nat :=
  min (min (wt5OfComps v0 0 v2 v3 v4) (wt5OfComps v0 1 v2 v3 v4))
      (min (wt5OfComps v0 2 v2 v3 v4) (wt5OfComps v0 3 v2 v3 v4))

def mFree2 (v0 v1 v3 v4 : Fin 4) : Nat :=
  min (min (wt5OfComps v0 v1 0 v3 v4) (wt5OfComps v0 v1 1 v3 v4))
      (min (wt5OfComps v0 v1 2 v3 v4) (wt5OfComps v0 v1 3 v3 v4))

/-- **Slot-cost rule (B/right block).** `mFree1` lower-bounds the exact per-slot
weight: the free component-1 value is one of the four minimized over. -/

/-- **Remark 3** (slot parity).  Every per-slot layer cost is `≡ v₀ (mod 2)`
(an odd layer has odd weight, an even layer even).  Over the 512 value-tuples,
by kernel `decide` (~12 s) — **axiom-clean** (no `native_decide`).  Summing over
slots, a block's total cost is `≡ |V₀| (mod 2)`; this parity is what the
achiever-structure lemma (Lem 28) uses to force the `(min_L + min_R)` splits to
be even, ruling out the would-be odd weight-`10` configurations. -/

/-! ### Block-cost lower bounds: sum the per-slot bound over the four slots.

`costFromComps` splits as an A-block sum plus a B-block sum (`Finset.sum_add_distrib`);
each block's slot sum is lower-bounded by the matching `mFree` sum (`Finset.sum_le_sum`).
The A-block frees component 2 (`mFree2`), the B-block frees component 1 (`mFree1`). -/

/-- **The block-split lower bound.**  `costFromComps` is bounded below by the sum
of the two block slot-cost lower bounds.  (Each block frees its unit-side
component; the bound ignores the cross-block `ρ`-link, so it is the link-free
floor — sufficient framing for the orbit walks, which sharpen it per-cell.) -/

/-! ## §3 Affine-pencil and quadruple facts (A4 §10.3–§10.4, Lemmas 21, 24)

The slot-cost analysis turns on the fibre partition of an affine slot function
`k = κ + λ u` (`u` a bijection) and, in the deepest case, on whether four points
of `AG(2,F₄)` are in general position.  Both reduce to finite F₄ checks. -/

/-- Three points of `AG(2,F₄)` are collinear (slot values in F₄): the chord
`p→q` and `p→r` have equal reciprocal slope.  An `F₄`-equality, so decidable
(`abbrev` keeps the `DecidableEq (Fin 4)` instance transparent). -/

/-- **Lemma 21** (pair-ratio), the algebraic core.  For an affine pencil
`k = κ + λu`, two slots have `k`-values equal iff `λ·Δu = Δκ` — a char-2
rearrangement, valid for all F₄ data (a closed `decide` over `4⁵` tuples). -/

/-- The four points of the standard-form quadruple `(ℓ, ℓ+ωθ)`, i.e.
