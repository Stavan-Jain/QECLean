# Research log

Index of moonshot attempts (novel-math research track). Each entry links to
`attempts/<name>/result.md`. **Failures are first-class outputs** — document
what was tried and why it didn't work.

  **d(gross [[144,12,12]]) ≥ 6 fully analytic** (3× the published
  Lin–Pryadko floor of 2; goal 3 of the Phase-A program), via the
  small-cycle theorem (d_base ≥ 6 by hand) + the h=2 cover transfer with
  the dangerous-sector factor-2 lemma (M) proven unconditionally. Pending
  one adversarial re-review before write-up; goals 1 (d = 12) and 2
  (BB-class bound) remain open. Lives in `experiments/bb_lab/` (not
  `attempts/`): [handoff](../experiments/bb_lab/notes/A_HANDOFF.md),

- 2026-06-12 — gross-bb-analytic-bound (goal 1 closed) — success
  (pending skeptic review) —
  **d(gross [[144,12,12]]) = 12, analytic**: the last statement (M-im)
  is proven by the confined-floor program (A3 Entries 22–26): hand
  engine lemmas (kill-multiset supports, T-classifiers from ψ₂² = ψ₃ψ₄
  and ψ₄ = ψ₁ψ₃, slope level-sets, the ρ²= 0 confinement with c₁ = c₂
  = 0 derived via column transforms) + surveyable finite residues
  (spine C-tables, 118 one-line ρ-link kills), double-cross-checked by
  the two independent machine closures. Owed: adversarial skeptic pass
  over Entries 16–26 before external write-up; goal 2 (BB-class bound)
  remains open. [A3 log entries
  19–26](../experiments/bb_lab/notes/A3_track1p1_log.md).

- 2026-06-12 — gross-bb-analytic-bound (goal 1 update) — partial —
  **d(gross) = 12 now holds at the verified-finite level, doubly
  machine-verified** by two independent routes: the value-grammar
  completion sweep (Entry 20: CRT value dictionary + affine-graph
  completions, no coset element of weight ≤ 11 in any nonzero Smith
  class) and the light-cycle flux census (Entry 21: all 990 weight-8 and
  13248 weight-10 non-boundary cycles have nonzero seam flux). The last
  open statement (M-im) is reduced to three bounded hand obligations
  (Entry 22: the confined ρ-floor already closes two of the five orbits
  outright; the rest reduce to a weight-exactly-10 equality analysis).
  All other links — (M), (R) ker δ = im Δ via the B²-homotopy, the
  no-double-wrap flux characterization, the inversion duality — are
  fully analytic. Support-only COST floors (Entry 19) and route-B hand
  classification at weight 10 (368 orbits, Entry 21) are documented
  dead ends. [A3 log entries
